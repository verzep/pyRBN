# Random Boolean Networks (RBNs)

Random Boolean Networks (RBNs) were introduced by Kauffman [1] in 1969 as a simple model for gene regulatory mechanisms. Despite their simplicty, they revealed complex behaviours which various subsequent studies attempted to clarify.

## Kauffman model

The system consists of $N$ elements $S_i$ with binary values $S_i \in {0,1}$
